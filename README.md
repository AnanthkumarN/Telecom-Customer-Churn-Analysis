## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handling missing values.
  - Converting categorical variables into numerical representations.
  - Removing outliers using IQR.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualizing customer demographics, churn rates, and service usage.
  - Creating box plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Gradient Boosting (e.g., XGBoost, if used)
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC Curve
- **Feature Importance Analysis**: Identify key drivers of churn.

## Data Description

The dataset contains the following columns (example):

- **CustomerID**: Unique ID for each customer.
- **Tenure**: Duration of subscription in months.
- **MonthlyCharges**: Monthly bill amount.
- **TotalCharges**: Total amount billed to date.
- **Churn**: Target variable indicating whether the customer churned.

Additional columns represent customer demographics and service usage metrics.

---

## Usage

- Run the notebook cell by cell to replicate the analysis.
- Update the dataset path if needed.
- Modify or extend the code to experiment with additional models or analysis techniques.
